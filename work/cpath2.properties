cpath2.provider.description=\
Pathway Commons integrates a number of pathway and molecular interaction databases \
supporting BioPAX and PSI-MI formats into one large BioPAX model, which can be \
queried using our web API (documented below). This API can be used by computational \
biologists to download custom subsets of pathway data for analysis, or can be used to \
incorporate powerful biological pathway and network information retrieval and query \
functionality into websites and software. \
For computational biologists looking for comprehensive biological pathway data, \
we also make available data archives in several formats. \
Try not to exceed ten concurrent connections, several hits per second, \
from one IP address to avoid being banned. We can add capacity based on demand. \
For more information and help, please visit our homepage at beta.pathwaycommons.org. \
Feel free to tell us more about yourself and your project. \
